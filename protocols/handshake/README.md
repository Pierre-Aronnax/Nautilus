# Nautilus Handshake Protocol

The `nautilus_handshake` module provides a **flexible and modular handshake framework** for establishing secure communication between nodes. It enables **customizable multi-step handshakes**, making it suitable for **secure authentication, key exchange, and protocol negotiation** in decentralized and distributed systems.

This module is built with **Rust** and leverages **Tokio** for asynchronous execution.

## 🌟 Features

### 🔄 **Modular Handshake System**
- Supports **multi-step handshakes** with **customizable steps**.
- Enables **insertion, removal, and modification** of handshake steps dynamically.
- Protocol-aware execution ensures **steps are executed only if compatible**.

### 🔐 **Security & Negotiation**
- Supports **cipher suite exchange** and **negotiation-based security**.
- Implements **authentication and key agreement steps**.
- Ensures **session key derivation** is executed securely.

### 🏗 **Error Handling**
- Provides structured errors through `HandshakeError`.
- Handles **negotiation failures**, **invalid responses**, and **I/O errors** gracefully.

### ⚡ **Asynchronous & Efficient**
- Uses **Tokio’s async runtime** for high-performance execution.
- Supports streaming-based handshake execution.

## 🏛 **Architecture Overview**

This module consists of the following core components:

### **1️⃣ Handshake Engine**
- **`Handshake`** – Orchestrates a sequence of steps to establish communication.
- Manages **adding, removing, and executing** handshake steps.

### **2️⃣ Handshake Steps**
- **`NodeHello`** – Initiates the handshake by sending a "HELLO".
- **`HelloResponse`** – Responds to the hello message.
- **`CipherSuiteExchange`** – Negotiates available cipher suites.
- **`CipherSuiteAck`** – Acknowledges a selected cipher suite.
- **`CustomProtocolStep`** – Allows integration of user-defined handshake logic.

### **3️⃣ Handshake Traits**
- **`HandshakeStep`** – Defines individual handshake steps.
- **`HandshakeStream`** – Abstracts the underlying I/O stream for transport.

### **4️⃣ Error Handling**
- **`HandshakeError`** – Covers:
  - **NegotiationFailed** – No common cipher suite found.
  - **AuthenticationFailed** – Identity verification failure.
  - **KeyAgreementFailed** – Issues in key exchange.
  - **SessionKeyDerivationFailed** – Secure session establishment failure.

# ⚠ Limitations
- Requires a defined protocol – Steps must be compatible with the handshake protocol ID.
- No built-in encryption – The handshake framework negotiates security but doesn’t encrypt messages by default.
- Does not support automatic retry – If a handshake fails, it must be retried manually.
# 🎯 Future Improvements
- ✅ Extend with TLS-based Handshake Support – Allow integration with existing TLS implementations.
- ✅ Add Retry & Timeout Handling – Improve reliability in unstable networks.
- ✅ Integrate with Decentralized Identity Systems – Support DID-based authentication.
