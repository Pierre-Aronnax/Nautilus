Feature Request List (FR-List)
1. Context-Aware Negotiation
Description: Add a NegotiationContext struct to include parameters like session IDs, priorities, and constraints.
Purpose: Enable more flexible and adaptive negotiation decisions.
Priority: High
Impact: Improves protocol adaptability and real-world usability.
2. Dynamic Weight Assignment
Description: Extend WeightedStrategy to allow weights to be dynamically determined at runtime.
Purpose: Handle runtime conditions like resource availability and user-defined policies.
Priority: Medium
Impact: Enhances decision-making in dynamic environments.
3. Conflict Resolution Mechanism
Description: Introduce fallback or resolution rules for cases with multiple matches or no optimal match.
Purpose: Avoid deadlocks in negotiation and provide robust decision-making.
Priority: High
Impact: Ensures graceful handling of conflicts or disagreements.
4. Negotiation Logs and Auditing
Description: Maintain logs of negotiation attempts, retries, and outcomes.
Purpose: Debugging, auditing, and improving protocol performance over time.
Priority: Medium
Impact: Simplifies troubleshooting and helps optimize negotiation strategies.
5. Parallel and Multi-Stage Negotiation
Description: Support simultaneous negotiation of multiple parameters or multi-stage negotiations.
Purpose: Handle complex protocols that require multiple negotiated aspects (e.g., cipher suite + compression).
Priority: Medium
Impact: Broadens applicability to more sophisticated protocols.
6. Adaptive Negotiation Strategies
Description: Dynamically switch strategies based on runtime metrics like latency, failure rates, or resource availability.
Purpose: Increase efficiency and robustness of the negotiation process.
Priority: High
Impact: Enhances performance in varying network conditions.
7. Negotiation Cancellation and Graceful Exits
Description: Add mechanisms to cancel or abort negotiation when retries are exhausted or conditions change.
Purpose: Conserve resources and avoid endless retries.
Priority: High
Impact: Ensures stability and responsiveness of the protocol.
8. Advanced Error Categorization
Description: Expand NegotiationError to include detailed categories like:
Timeout
NoSupportedParameters
ProtocolViolation
Purpose: Improve debugging and user feedback.
Priority: Medium
Impact: Simplifies troubleshooting and enhances user experience.
9. Support for Multilateral Negotiation
Description: Extend support for negotiations involving multiple parties (e.g., distributed systems, mesh networks).
Purpose: Broaden the protocol's application in decentralized environments.
Priority: Medium
Impact: Makes the protocol suitable for advanced use cases like IoT or blockchain systems.
10. Negotiation Timeouts
Description: Add a timeout feature to enforce limits on how long negotiation attempts can take.
Purpose: Avoid indefinite hangs in the protocol.
Priority: High
Impact: Ensures responsiveness in real-time systems.
11. Integration with Machine Learning
Description: Use historical negotiation data to train models for predicting optimal parameters.
Purpose: Improve efficiency and adapt to evolving scenarios.
Priority: Low
Impact: Adds intelligence to the negotiation process for advanced deployments.
12. Backward Compatibility
Description: Provide a mechanism for falling back to older versions of the protocol if negotiation fails.
Purpose: Ensure compatibility with legacy systems.
Priority: Medium
Impact: Extends the protocolâ€™s usability to older environments.
